To run this implementation run the script file by typing the following command on the terminal.

./multicore 5 10 1000 1

where 
the first argument 5 indicate the dimension of LP to be solved;
the second argument 10 indicate the number of runs for average readings;
the third argument 1000 indicate the number of LPs to be solved;
the last argument 1 indicate the number of negatives on RHS(right-hand-side) of the LP constraints (that determines an LP which is of type initial basic solution as infeasible)
